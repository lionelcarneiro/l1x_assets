    "description": "Layer One X (L1X) is a fourth-generation decentralized platform designed to make interoperability between blockchains seamless and efficient. It allows developers to create new multi-chain applications or extend existing ones with cross-chain capabilities. It provides interoperability across EVM and altVM networks. As of February 2025, there are over 160 decentralized full validator nodes with over 2.5M+ Cross Chain Messages Passed. L1X has over 250,000 community members across its socials.\n\nThe network operates on a unique Proof-of-X consensus mechanism, ensuring security through staking while maintaining decentralization. L1X is supported by two types of nodes:\n• Full Validator Nodes (FVNs): Responsible for securing the blockchain’s state.\n• X-Talk Nodes: Handle cross-chain communication, enabling scalable and efficient multi-chain applications. It also features an inbuilt Oracle system.\n\nDevelopers have the flexibility to build on L1X using its high-performance Rust-based Virtual Machine with its proprietary compiler for WASM to eBPF for speed and efficiency. Alternatively, they can use Solidity, as L1X is fully EVM-compatible, making it easy to deploy applications across multiple blockchains.",
